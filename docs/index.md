# Ember-Show Addon

This addon provides you with an Ember modifier that allows you to toggle showing/hiding an element.

The difference between this and conditionally rendering content via the `if`/`unless` helpers is that
an element marked with the `show` modifier will always be rendered and remain in the DOM; the `show`
modifier only toggles the display property of the element.

## Installing the addon

You install this addon like any other.

```sh
ember install ember-show
```
